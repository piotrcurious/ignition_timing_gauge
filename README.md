# ignition_timing_gauge
Visualize ignition timing (coming from ECU)
Created by BingAI

Visualizes ignition signal and it's timing in relation to cam shaft sensor.

Usefull to help determining set points for engine temperature, 
load , rpm and fuel type. 

prompt:
create Arduino code implementing graphical ignition timing indicator by using 4-1 cam shaft sensor signal and ignition module signal. use 128x32 monochrome adafruit OLED module for display. Include dwell and ignition times in the visualization. Use analog input pin to allow setting a dotted line visualizing expected timing value.
